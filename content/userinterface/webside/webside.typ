The website of this project consists of two main parts: Liveview and Settings. The Liveview part are one or more sub pages - one for each CAN interface - while the Settings part is just one Settings page. To navigate between these pages, a navigation bar is provided, where you can access the Settings directly by clicking a button and the different Liveview pages by selecting the available CAN interfaces from a drop down menu. The navigation bar also works as a wrapper for the whole page, since the project name `YellowPirat` and the subtitle `CAN Datalogger` are readable at the top.
